# Studio

Showcases and small projects. Most became templates used to help other developers.
Included in the listings are a link to each experience. Most script files use assets packaged within the engine, and can be properly utilized with `.rbxm` exports.

To download an experience, open the page, right click the `...` menu (top right), and select `Edit in Studio`.

[Complex](https://www.roblox.com/games/15687480692/complex-number-test) - Demonstration of complex number module, plots four graphs in the real and complex space.
- Actual use cases include fractal generation, animation interpolation, and creating quaternions (although the latter is built-in as the [CFrame](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/datatypes/CFrame)).

[Part Manipulation](https://www.google.com/search?q=metatables+are+cool) - Demonstration for a module. Broken link as experience transfer failed (will try again soon). Used in a [friend's game](https://www.roblox.com/games/180364455)
- Identify and orchestrate unanchored objects to follow parametrically-defined trajectories
- Accept and modify lua functions and respective environments to provide a seamless experience in module use.

[Jeroo](https://www.roblox.com/games/10717840008) - Reimplementation of [Jeroo](https://www.jeroo.org/) into modularized instructions in a different engine. Demonstration showcases block-coding to build algorithms by interacting with said module.

[Tree Grower](https://www.roblox.com/games/15441049128/Tree-growing-algo) - Demo for model, iterative-step-approach to natural tree growth. Also in /Modules.
- Demo for creating unique cotton plants in a collaborative farm scene, (hence module contents) but expanded to to replicate all trees and shrubs.

[WIP_bxyfza](https://www.roblox.com/games/72926187589698) - remake of [Papa's Freezeria](https://www.coolmathgames.com/0-papas-freezeria)
- Just a game I used to play in school; Created for fun and to demonstrate use of camera-scene modules which improves upon the native Camera class.

[Blackhole](https://www.roblox.com/games/107266450840392) - Simulation demo for a [friend's game](https://www.roblox.com/games/180364455)

[Pacman](https://www.roblox.com/games/77552657421964) - Map and control framework for a [friend's game](https://www.roblox.com/games/180364455)
- construct and traverse 2-dimensional maps to-be-implemented with procedural generation

[Infgen](https://www.roblox.com/games/10574847190) - Infinitely generates... the same space over and over. Just included as early-on practice in my journey.

[Spectral Diffusion](https://www.roblox.com/games/121216046107807) - Demo to imitate refraction of light through glass mediums
- Reflection and refraction is randomized but seeded to be consistent with the given medium positioning. Used in a [friend's game](https://www.roblox.com/games/180364455)

[World Map Challenge](https://www.roblox.com/games/10661570694) - Game to locate countries in a timed fashion upon an interactive map. Used to improve my coding ability and study for an AP class.
