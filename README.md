# Luau
Lua modules, plugins, experiences, exploits.
Most designated for Roblox engine (Luau), however minor revisions can be made in some to support Lua.

Scripts with module dependencies have been modified to better-format for Github, and may need to be modified.
Most non-specific modules will run without any modification.

## [Modules](/Modules/)
General directory for code used as modules in other scripts. These can be- and have been used by others!

## [Studio](/Studio/)
Source for different algorithm & engine showcases. Some files may be duplicated within Luau/Modules.
All experiences can be played and downloaded (see /Studio's readme).

## [Exploits](/Exploits/)
Tens of thousands of lines of dedication from extensive reverse-engineering of experiences. **Educational purposes only; all discoveries were later reported to experiences' respective developers.**
Composed of game-specific modules* and a 2024 passion project. Unfortunately, it is dificult to utilize many of these without revising platform-specific functions.

*some files may be duplicated into Luau/Modules.
