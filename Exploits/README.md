my final project in this folder was [sd2](/Exploits/sd2), a ~10k line compilation of my proudest works.\
See why here: https://x.synapse.to/ (onto better things)

[misc_archived](/Exploits/misc_archived/) contains most of my old scripts and a couple forks of others' work to include automation and webhook status-updates.
